          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> Here's an interview I did with <a href="http://literategamer.com/post/158150263534/dwarf-fortress-tarn-adams">the Literate Gamer</a>.
<br>
          <br>
So we have a map up!  The borderline useless 'c'ivilization screen has been replaced by a world map you can scroll around (the old civ/treaty information will still be available in there).  You can get site information, travel times, approximate populations, diplomacy states and so forth.
<br>
          <br>
The odd time differences continue to cause trouble as usual -- on a medium map, going from tip to tip on a world-spanning crescent shaped continent takes ~18 days.  So if there aren't weird interruptions (like your dwarf squad stopping for a bender at a human tavern), you can expect even the longest journies to be over in a month or so, which passes relatively quickly in fort mode.  We might adjust the times a bit if it's too strange, but we'd like to keep everything as consistent as possible (since there are lots of non-player armies moving around the map at these speeds).
<br>
          <br>
Next up, we should be sending our first squad out of the fort and into the world!  This will bring up all sorts of issues (what happens to the squad/military interface when half of a squad has walked off while the rest are dawdling, does an off-site squad try to return through an active fort siege?, etc), and we'll tackle them as we go.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> And here's the promised <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf//index.php?topic=159164.msg7384205#msg7384205">Future of the Fortress reply</a>.  Fort mode work begins tomorrow!</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> I've returned from San Francisco and GDC!  The talk seemed to go well, I met a lot of people...  and was recognized on both of my flights, which is a new one.  The burnout is real, though.  I should be back together in a day or two.  We'll have Future of the Fortress up tomorrowish -- here's <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf//index.php?topic=163115.0">the Bay 12 Report.</a>  Then we can get started on fort mode!</li>

<li id="2017-02-22" class="dev_progress">
          <span class="date">02/22/2017</span>
          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> Alright, I'm ready to move to dwarf mode for this release!  The main features will be the ability to send dwarf squads off the map, artifact-based diplomacy with sieging forces and others, and artifact-interested questers and critters coming to the fort.
<br>
          <br>
That'll have to start next month -- in a few days I'll be leaving for GDC.  It was healthy for Bay 12 when I went there for the first time last year, so I figured I give it another go.  I'll be back on the 4th, so there will be a delay on the monthly report and the Future of the Fortress reply.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> More progress...  the artifact encounter problems I'm aware of are fixed, and NPC questers can go on near-fruitless quests in play to find artifacts known to be lost in the wilds (and find them if they happen upon the exact spot).  You can sometimes find these ill-fated heroes wandering around out there, but there isn't currently a way for them to get more refined information.
<br>
          <br>
Your adventurer can now name any of their legally-nameable objects (so e.g. no arrow stacks, but you can name individual arrows).  This elevates the items to historical status, so you'll get events recorded about them.  That doesn't mean other people will care about them.  There's still a bit to do, and GDC is creeping up at the end of the month (I have a short talk again), but we'll hopefully be through the boring cleanup part soon and get to dwarf mode off-map squads.</li>

<li id="2017-02-07" class="dev_progress">

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> The adventure mode cleaning continues.  The logs will be a bit dull while I test and correct, unless something amusing happens.  The guards have moved on from interrogating me over delivered artifacts to instead interrogating their own master.  I returned an artifact, and the lord took the figurine over to an empty pedestal in the hall and stood there making cheerful remarks.  A guard, confused again, ran over and demanded the location of the figurine.  The lord was like, "Over my dead body!"  They would have started fighting if I didn't break out to debug.  I think in this case the guard didn't understand furniture, and also didn't think about their loyalties in the context of item encounters, and so flipped out when the item became "invisible".  I'll keep smoothing it out!  I've also cleaned up some other random issues.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> All right, so we're looking at four chunks left for this release, which'll take some time yet.  We have to polish off adventure mode, which involves a lot of testing and tweaking.  Today I added some more popups to the trade screen so you'd know your artifact gifts have been properly recognized and continued to fix up artifact transfer problems.  There are still all sorts of strange things going on.  For instance, when I returned a figurine to a lord, he stuffed it into a personal pouch where his guards couldn't see it, so some of them started interrogating me since they thought I'd hidden it and didn't actually see the hand-off.  Lots of permutations to work through.
<br>
          <br>
Second of the chunks, there's fort mode!  We need to handle artifact diplomacy and the sending of recovery squads off the map, which should be entertaining.  Third, we need to finish the map changes I put off (e.g. kobold caves).  Last, there are some random requests and promises that have accumulated (some memory address help for modders, a little bit of XML, a few priority bug fixes).</li>

<li id="2017-01-16" class="dev_progress">
          <span class="date">01/16/2017</span>
          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> I went ahead and added the ability for player adventurers to assume identities today.  You can't pretend to be specific historical figures or deities, but you can be pick a name, profession, origin civilization and object of worship.  All positive and negative reputations will be associated to that identity for as long as you assume it, unless you screw up.  You can have multiple identities and flip between them (or return to your true identity).  I'm still patching up some weird behaviors, but we're almost out of this specific identity grind now.</li>

<li id="2017-01-10" class="dev_progress">
          <span class="date">01/10/2017</span>
          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> Ha ha, this rabbit hole is pretty deep!  There was a cascading split of various reputation data objects according to true, visual, historical and false identities, and lots of tracing up and down partial data to see where a new bit of information should be stored or what it implies.  It is taking a while to sort it out.  My brain broke a few days ago, but I feel more like we're coasting downhill on it now.  Some problems we had of rumors revealing the identities of people they shouldn't have (especially as the rumors aged) have been patched up -- it can keep track of information about false identities indefinitely, and it can also keep track of independent reputations for the same person between several identities, even for old data where that distinction used to improperly collapse.</li>

<li id="2017-01-04" class="dev_progress">
          <span class="date">01/04/2017</span>
          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> I'm having fun chasing down issues with agent identities and rumors and so forth.  A lot of the conversation/reputation code wasn't able to cope with the change, and we've needed to differentiate more between visual identification or whether an incident just involves the real and fake historical identities of people in the abstract, especially when you ask a person their opinion about somebody but only know an alias (which you don't know is an alias).  People now think more carefully about where their information came from when they decide what they think of people, and do some cross-referencing of known identities and so forth, but they also have to skip certain rumors in their heads that pertain to a person where they can't make the connection (because they don't know a given alias or true identity).  So if you ask after a goblin agent using their true name or an identity used in a previous town, people in the current town the agent is infiltrating will properly say that they don't know who you are talking about, even if they have a lot of information about the agent under their current alias -- or they might have an opinion about the old identity if they heard a rumor about it.  Where the game previously formed a single set of reputations for one historical figure, people can now give different answers for the true historical figure and each identity, as well as what they think on sight (which may or may not involve any names -- they keep track of which identities they associate with the physical appearance).
<br>
          <br>
We're also trying to keep more identity information intact as rumors fade out over time, to stop covers from being blown by the passage of time, and we also want a bit more realism in terms of linking witnesses that know the physical appearance to somebody else in town that got to know a name/alias of the people and their appearance, but didn't see the incident.  For example, if the player robs somebody without saying their name, a problem with the new system was that only the people that witnessed the event thought ill of the player even after a few days, since other townspeople could no longer make the link between the player and the event.  However, if the player talks to enough people in a small enough town either before or after the robbery, then whatever name/alias they used should become linked to the incident after a bit of time (the normal rumor spread time).  It's difficult to get it right, and it's not going to be quite up to the level where it'll need to be for the justice/crime features later on, but we're trying to keep everything pointed in the right direction.</li>

<br>
          <br>
We finished up the monks and other new critters, and today was the first real day engaging with agents enjoying their new covers.  The last agent I looked at involved a human town on the border of two separate evil lands that was itself half-goblin by year 50.  The demons could send in goblin agents to collect information that arrived there without much suspicion (they'd use humans for the towns farther from the border).
<br>
          <br>
Kutsmob Dentblack decided to assume the identity of a prophet of Oled the Gleeful Healing, the god of justice, and wandered around town shouting about the impending doom of the world.  Over the years, he befriended a human priest as well as the gangster boss that hung out at the Fragrant Brunch tavern.  The friendships are stored asymmetrically -- they thought of the 'prophet' as a buddy, while Kutsmob considered them information sources.  
<br>
          <br>
At the same time, a human from a civilization to the south had infiltrated the town pretending to be a petty criminal, and a goblin from the other evil civilization, pretending to be a bard, had made it in as well.  Kutsmob's tradecraft was lacking, and he was 'befriended' by both of these agents, though neither of them knew that Kutsmob was also an agent -- they just thought he was a good information source -- and Kutsmob himself simply thought he had a few buddies to help him pass time during his assignment.  It was fun to load up the world and see them all talking together with the ganglord at the Fragrant Brunch.</li>

<li id="2016-12-12" class="dev_progress">
          <span class="date">12/12/2016</span>
          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> It wasn't strictly necessary, as usual, but we're adding a few more cover identities to be used by agents sneaking into towns to collect information (they can also use the existing artist, scholar and warrior professions as cover).  In order for the agents not to stick out for the player, their cover professions need to be held by real counterparts.  So there'll be prophets, pilgrims, monks, peddlers and petty criminals.  They won't get many mechanics, but they'll be around.  The stuff we do add for them have a secondary purpose to set the stage for the myth release -- the prophecies are stored in a way which aligns with the myth generator we wrote (though that's not coming in yet), and it also relates to an expanded language framework (that's not coming in yet either).  It should be good to toy around with those ideas a bit first before we get to the full implementation.</li>

<li id="2016-12-05" class="dev_progress">
          <span class="date">12/05/2016</span>
          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> I started the month by doing a survey of rumors and artifacts in several worlds to see how well agents sent out from goblin civilizations will fit into the world.  Mostly, they had artifact conflicts with other goblins, so I tweaked some things -- even then, there still aren't an incredible number of agent-relevant situations at first.  For instance, a goblin civilization sought two items stolen by kobolds and one held by a dragon.  If however, say, the player were to bring one of those back to a human leader, the goblins wouldn't have any way to know without having an agent in place, so it should still be worthwhile.  And there are occasional world-gen situations where the idea works.
<br>
          <br>
Working a bit on the criminals in town in preparation for the even more ill-natured agents to come and associate with them.  Pulling many criminals out of the sewers and catacombs and into some of the taverns and out on the streets and so on, provided they vaguely fit in to the larger community.</li>

If a situation goes particularly badly, an artifact seeker can kill an artifact holder and then actually remember to pick up the artifact to bring it back to wherever they are going, which is unusual since adventure mode characters are generally so oblivious to ground objects.  Or it can be more happy.  I suspect that next month will start with work on the agents and ne'er-do-wells we promised back in the Sept 26 log.</li>

So if you are a questing adventurer bringing an artifact back to a location, for instance, you might run into other questers, guards, or entity representatives before or during your return, and they should react in some way or another without waiting for you to initiate everything.  This might be as simple as you riding a wave of praise back to wherever the artifact needs to go, or it might turn out quite differently if you aren't trusted.  The wave of praise should also turn sour if you turn out not to be taking the artifact where they think you are -- but it'll have to give you some wiggle room as well...  so we're trying to sort that kind of thing out.

There are six levels of knowing the location of a held artifact as it stands:  having it yourself, seeing somebody else holding it at a location with your own eyes, hearing from somebody that somebody was holding it at a location recently, hearing from somebody that somebody has it (but not where), generally knowing in some legendsy fashion that it is said to be held by somebody, and not having any idea.  The knowledge fades over a course of weeks and years while maintaining longer-term reputation effects, and it also has to constantly work in any new information and so forth according to their time stamps (at the individual, site gov, site culture and civ levels).  But it seems to be working so far!  It's very fiddly, but this should take us a long way as artifacts get more interesting (during the magic and economic releases, etc).</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> I've updated the dev page colorations to indicate where we're at so far.  It has been a slog, getting through the knowledge/rumors/incident/witness reports/historical events, since items can be moved in all sorts of ways and we haven't really been concerned about anybody remembering anything about artifact positions before this point in the game.  There have been all sorts of conundrums and edge cases.  Now everybody's eyes light up when a bard strolls into a room holding Classic Hamlet (which was a book about his home village, I guess), and if your adventurer walks up and wrestles the book away and stores it on a bookshelf in a distant library, witnesses at each stage will understand the who and what and where in case some Hamlet quester comes calling later on.  I'm slowly starting to emerge from this sort of work, though there are still several conversation utterances and reputation effects that need to be finished.</li>

If there are people around, they'll create witness reports (which later turn into rumors) for each of those, but the final artifact location is the most important, so I have to make sure the right old reports get cancelled and so forth, even if some of the events last longer or are missed by certain people and not others, and so on.  For instance, if one of the witnesses only sees the part in that sequence where you pick the artifact up, they might think you are stealing it, which is sort of reasonable, but not if you just brought it back yourself moments earlier -- they could afford to be a bit more circumspect, maybe just say something and you can be like, "nah, it's cool, I just brought this back and want to give it to somebody".  But that's hard to get working, especially as the overall situation becomes murky and complicated.  We'll do what we can!
<br>
          <br>
I've done lots of tests of slightly different situations in the same room over and over.  I have a little teleporter debug command that causes the last artifact mentioned in a conversation to appear in my hands, which really speeds things up.</li>

They can join up in parties temporarily if there are other like-minded people in their journey's starting town.  We still need to handle the details of their site infiltrations and reputations, but it's good to have artifacts moving around.  I think the trickiest part will probably be getting them to handle artifacts held by people, especially moving ones (including your adventurers), and that should be coming up after I handle the new rumors and some other issues.  There are lots of conversation elements to handle too.  So, tons of work to do, but we're moving forward.</li>

<br>
          <br>
Sites can now post invisible messages about artifacts to mimic the game's conversation system for your adventurer.  There are various sorts -- families seeking heirlooms, scholars seeking books from ruined libraries, and so on.  The next step is to get the non-player characters to respond to the messages and get the artifacts moved around by them.  Then we can move to player involvement.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> The main map work left to do for this release is the kobold site update.  I'm going to take a break from that for a change of pace, though, and move over to artifact rumors and getting some artifact-associated critters running around.  The spread of artifact location information needs to be a little more refined than what we currently have available, so there'll be some preliminary work on that.  I'm going to start by getting the various wandering taverngoers to gather and spread site rumors, which should give us a good foundation for information transfer in the friendly human-dwarf-elf areas, mostly.
<br>
          <br>
Since they aren't regular travelers, and we really need their civilizations to know about artifacts, the goblins and their demon masters will have to pick up information on the edge of the tavern ecosystem.  For this time, that'll mean having their own agents running around, which should be cool.  They might have to interface with shadier people in town (who'll have to be understood a little better by the game), or they might blend in themselves if their race wouldn't be out of place (kidnapped humans/elves/dwarves grown to adulthood might finally be useful for something specific).  Doing this correctly involves quite a few systems that aren't in yet, and we'll either do or skip those systems based on what we think we can complete in a timely fashion.  This is a good time to finally get some more nefarious tendrils out in the world, though, and we're planning on messing with it a bit.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> World generation fortresses are a bit more navigable now (managed to get to the surface from a deep site without a surface connection a few times), though there is always more to do there.  Some of the apparently disconnected forts just has really bizarre ways to the main staircase -- having to go from the wide hallway to a side hallway, through a door, down a side hallway, through a stockpile, through a door, around a corner, and back to a wide hallway which connects to the main stairwell.  Now it tries to ensure that the wide hallways are connected from end to end, which is practically enough.  It would still be better to have some engravings and the ability to ask directions.
<br>

I've also gotten about halfway through the artifact storage locations for the various site types and situations.</li>

The game has display cases and pedestals now, in all modes.  Next I'm going to finish the display jobs in dwarf mode before I get back to maps.  You'll be able to display any non-large object you like, and there'll be new thoughts for displayed items similar to the admiration of architecture.  So you can set up artifact display areas, or you can just use regular masterpieces, or junk, or skulls, as you see fit.  The displayed items show like the food on tables so you can admire them yourself.</li>

We're now ready to situate the artifacts in tile map locations and then move the interactions into the two play modes.  This process will surely bring up some issues with what we've done in world generation, but hopefully it's mostly okay!  Map code can take a lot of time to update and change (since it's prone to bugs, especially with the third dimension), and I'll try not to get bogged down, but we should also see some interesting additions.  More as I get to each civilization!</li>

There was an unfortunate elven civilization called the Distant Oak that lost three druids in three years.  The last one was killed by goblins and had their body hung from a pine tree, which must have made the goblins happy since they organized a yearly candlelight procession commemorating the event back at their tower.  On the 110th occasion of the procession, the dragon Niweni attacked, killing several goblins and dwarves.  Finally the beast entered the tower and stole the Renowned Gill, a legendary crossbow created by a dwarf for the chameleon demon 20 years before, bringing it back to the cave.  180 years later, the crossbow is still there, along with the dragon.  There weren't any attempts to recover it -- such civilization-level quests are the last step for these world gen changes.</li>

Artifacts can now be given between entities during peace or when peace is made.  Heroes can also make journeys (potentially with buddies) to recover heirlooms (still need entity/religious recovery).
<br>
          <br>
I also included artifact claims in war/diplomacy calculations.  For instance, in events spanning 124 years, the periclase bracelet Lusterlabored was made by a dwarf in a goblin tower and given to the dwarven master (the original demon was killed by an elephant while invading the elves).  Stored in the tower for several years, it was eventually stolen by the kobold Tobogochrursnus.  Tobogochrursnus brought the bracelet along on various thefts, only to be cornered by a human hamlet lord, Emim Squashchewed.  Emim kept Lusterlabored as a family heirloom for forty years, but this eventually brought the attention of the same dwarven master back in the goblin tower.  A war was launched, and Emim went to defend the main human city of Largeplot, where he was killed by the elf Ber (who had grown up in the tower).  Ber took the bracelet and assumed the position of administrator over the conquered town.  She had a more or less peaceful rule for decades, until the rampage of a werehyena found Ber devoured and Lusterlabored with a new owner.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> Worldgen invaders will now loot artifacts stored in buildings, and thieves can steal artifacts from them as well.  For instance, we had Thil, the leader of a group of dawn worshippers living in a human market town which was unfortunately beset by elves over the humans' display of hunting trophies.  The elves routinely attacked the town and ate people, and on the third attack they drowned Thil as an example for the other humans.  The grieving worshippers entombed the body in a crypt under the town, but they took Thil's bejeweled linen skirt and named it Glowedlull, placing it in their temple.  It only took another year before the elves returned and ate some more people, and looted the temple, taking Glowedlull back to their forest home.  Peace was made ten years later, but I haven't gotten to the friendlier side of artifact transfer yet, so the skirt is still with the elves!  Next up we'll be adding worldgen heroic artifact quests and gifts to round out the worldgen portion of the artifact release.  Hopefully all of our recent additions taken together will provide enough backing for fortress mode and adventure mode artifact interactions.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> This week was work on underlying mechanics in support of artifact claims.  The main interesting addition was a sort of family placeholder mechanic to make heirlooms work.  The initial couples all get associated family structures, and then those links are passed along to the children and so forth.  Of course, this opens up all kinds of world-determining issues, depending on how marriage interacts with family membership and which child has which inheritance rights over heirlooms etc etc etc, and so forth.  This isn't the release to get into it (the family/status/property/law release will make a better attempt).  For now, it runs an "importance" check on the family groups during a marriage -- if there is no winner, then it just flips a coin.
<br>
          <br>
Artifacts will pass down family lines to keep them in play longer and to set up interesting conflicts.  Even without conflicts programmed yet, we've had some interesting situations.  One medium world I ran for 125 years had a dwarven hero named Fath that killed the hydra Osplu Juicepukes.  After the fight, she named her steel shield Gladdashed and it became a family heirloom attached to the Kosoth Giltmirrors family group (Kosoth was an original dwarf, and by the end of world gen, that line had 228 living members -- Fath was a grandchild).
<br>
          <br>
During a later koala demon invasion, a goblin named Ngokang Spideryweaver killed Fath and claimed the shield -- even though the invasion failed, Ngokang survived and took the shield back to the goblin capital of Ghoulsullied.  A few years later, Ngokang was murdered and Gladdashed lost in the goblin pits, but Ngokang's family still had a claim on it (it's unclear whether goblins will often have strong family mechanics when we remove the placeholder, since it's not a typical value setting for them, but it's fine for now).  Ngokang's family group was also identified with an original creature -- Bax Burialscourges, a goblin dancer that was still alive and a member of the Whispers of Evil performance troupe.  That goblin family had 49 living members.  Presumably, as we continue, it's possible that these 228 dwarves and 49 goblins would come into conflict over Gladdashed in various ways as the artifact is found, stolen, claimed, lost again, etc., especially since it's likely with that many dwarves that several of them would have hands on the levers of power that determine whether their whole civilization goes to war and so on.</li>

Sometimes they are potentially useful, like the steel spear used to kill a giant, and sometimes you get an elf commemorating the slaying of a minotaur by naming their wooden low boot which presumably saved their life or something.  Our first official holy relic:  the hemp trousers of the "First Orange" of a god of light.  The second was the Fortress of Grief, a totem made from the skull of another religion's high priest.  They placed the skull in the temple, while the rest of the body was entombed in the catacombs under the city.  Next up we'll be doing artifact claims and various mechanics to get these artifacts moving, fought over, and otherwise affected.</li>

It's more abstract than the standard in-play fortress process, but it uses about the same variety of materials (it doesn't do furniture yet).  Next up we'll add a few more classes of items (weapons/armor named by heroes, holy relics), and then we'll make claims on artifacts and make the movement of artifacts in world generation more interesting to set the stage for in-play additions.</li>

Here's <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/redist/df_64_test_osx.tar.bz2">an OSX 64-bit test version.</a>  The main obstacle to being through with the 64-bit version is actually a 32-bit version now -- we lost 32-bit Linux with all the updates we had to do for 64-bits.</li>

We've been playing around with magic systems for years, ever since DRAGSLAY.BAS, and are looking forward to finally being able to place the dwarves into a more meaningful, mysterious and exciting universe!

<img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> We'll start in on an artifact release once the 64-bit versions are complete.  We might get away with one release there, but the myth/magic dev items will almost certainly happen over multiple releases, and we won't get to everything on the first pass.
<br>
          <br>
Work on the 64-bit version is ongoing.  So far we have <a href="http://bay12games.com/dwarves/redist/df_sdl_64_wintest.zip">a windows test version</a> and <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/redist/df_64test_linux.tar.bz2">a linux test version.</a>  Here's <a href="http://bay12games.com/dwarves/redist/df_sdl_32_wintest.zip">a 32-bit Windows version</a> that should clean up some DLL issues.  We should be almost through with Mac as well -- just need to clean up the sound library situation.</li>

<br>
          <br>
As part of the recent fix that brought armor back to invading soldiers and others, we need to deal with the effectiveness of armor, since there are too many fights that never end.  To this end, we're going to do armor item damage, some indirect combat damage to joints/necks that get whacked, and some combat AI to make people remove helmets from unconscious opponents.  Then the release should be ready.</li>

Work orders won't decrease the number of jobs on identical orders any more, and they should store items properly in locations like libraries without hauling them back and forth over and over.  Paper slurries can be stored, and traded masterpieces in containers shouldn't trigger art defacement effects.  The weird broken entry shouldn't appear at the end of the stocks list.  Stone axes will work in adventure mode again.</li>

That's still the plan...  it just stretched out a bit since the compiler installation crashed and destroyed my system.  Things are partially back together now, with the new compiler in place.  I've been playing around with its static code analysis tool, which located some interesting typos which have probably screwed up the medical bedrest and ghost behavior among other things.</li>

	<li>Made embark profiles load fish properly</li>
	<li>Made assigning an animal to a restraint remove it from pasture assignments properly</li>

	<li>Allowed metal mechanisms to be made from the job manager</li>
	<li>Made dragonfire affect metal items and generally amplified fire effects a bit</li>
	<li>Stopped veins in large mineral clusters from being improperly restricted</li>
	<li>Stopped placement issue with minerals that had more than one specific environment</li>

Woodcutters shouldn't use training axes, and you should be able to make metal mechanisms from the job manager.  It'll also show the mechanism material in the job's name.  Embark profiles should load fish properly instead of cancelling them all.  I made dragonfire affect metal items again after a long hiatus, though fire effects in general are still a bit odd.

There are lots of details over <a href="http://www.dwarfmoot.com/">at the event page</a>.
<br>
          <br>
Bug-fixing has been underway.  There was an issue with the material display when building adventurer sites -- it was still counting some objects you had already used, so be sure to check the material is actually on hand when you try to build.  I also stopped mountains from incorrectly restricting actions like sleeping.
<br>
          <br>
I cleaned up some issues with restraints and cages vs. pastures that were causing animals to be moved too much or not often enough.  I also fixed a few problems with mineral placement that screwed up native platinum veins in larger clusters and a few other configurations.
<br>
          <br>
I've adjusted how bone pain works to stop people from giving into pain and going unconscious when their toes are broken.
<br>
          <br>
"Gigantic" shouldn't occur all the time in animal descriptions now.  Items placed on tables in adventure mode shouldn't duplicate.  Bees should appear in temperate forests.  Glazers will gain skill properly now and improvement reactions more generally will apply skill properly.  And a few other small fixes.</li>

With the work order additions and adventurer-created sites, this one ended up with more new stuff and fewer bug fixes than expected, and my version calculator just tipped over at 0.43.  You can use the new 'b' site building option in adventure mode to create a site (outside the bounds of other sites).  For dwarf mode work orders, you can set conditions and details from the manager.  You can also create orders tied to specific shops from their workshop profiles.
<br>
          <br>
A miscellaneous note: in order to retire at the adventurer sites you create, you'll need to name the site, create a main hall zone, and claim the hall during conversation (or while shouting to yourself).
<br>
          <br>
Next up we'll be doing more bug fix releases to make sure we have a vaguely presentable DF before we disappear into a new compiler and 64 bits.

          <br>
New stuff
<br>
<ul class="itemized">	<li>Ability to build up new sites in adv mode, either yourself or by assigning companions</li>

	<li>Ability to chop down trees in adv mode</li>
	<li>Ability to make stone axes in adv mode</li>
	<li>Ability to pull branches from trees in adv mode</li>
	<li>Can put start conditions on work orders (by amount of resources or dependence on other work orders)</li>
	<li>Can specify materials/images/etc. in work orders</li>
	<li>Can create work order from profile which is tied to specific workshop</li>

I'm currently working on allowing work orders to trigger other work orders upon activation or completion.  I think that'll be it for conditions for this release.  Then all we have left are work order job detail settings as well as some bugs to fix.</li>

I began doing start/restart conditions for work orders as well.  Some of the most basic conditions you'd want are still pretty convoluted, like needing empty food storage items (barrels or pots), appropriate uncompromised plants and a lack of available alcohol for brewing jobs.  In order to get around that, you can press a button to have the game try to guess what conditions you'd like based on the type of order (and then you can tweak the numbers).  You can also build the conditions up manually...  or you will be able to once I get it done!</li>

I didn't get back to work until today, and I'm only eating full meals now, so I'm not quite myself yet.  The maximum number of work orders a given shop accepts at a time can be set, and the shop can also ban work orders entirely or by labor type.  Hopefully the coming days will just be super super normal and I can finish this off, maybe with a bit of rest.</li>

You can also set perpetual orders.  It doesn't place more than one job per shop and instead of waiting to renew them it checks jobs on completion to see if they should stick around.  So that works better all around.  Of course, I'd have liked to be further along, but I'm not the only one working.  Some friendly bacteria are doing a colony management sim in my head, and they managed to implement all sorts of impressive routines.  Rapid temperature fluctuations without lag, top-notch eyelid closure mechanics, something reddish and growing...  it will be fine.  It will all be fine.
<br>
          <br>
Next up, we're going to do more with restricting orders from certain workshops and other such limits, some conditional work order stuff, and the job detail changes for them.</li>

I added zones to adventurer sites, so you can assign companions homes and so forth, but I've also been working on cleaning up the creation myth/magic system generator a bit in time for the little GDC talk.  That's coming up on the 14th, so it won't continue to be a disruption for much longer, and all the work will make it into DF anyway, so it's all good.  More primordial beast viscera washing ashore than I expected, but that's okay.
<br>
          <br>
In any case, the zones are almost done -- I just need to allow you to declare actual locations like the halls in human villages so you can claim your own site with a named group.  Then a few more site tweaks, work order changes, bugs and done.</li>

<br>
          <br>
I've cleaned up various issues that arose with adventurer-made sites.  The main problem was that since the sites are larger than 1x1 at the dwarf embark map scale (they are up to 3x3 right now), they could cross world map tile edge boundaries, and that opened up various issues.  Having fixed what came up, we are much closer to allowing dwarf embarks to cross world map tile boundaries as well, though there is still a bit to do there.
<br>
          <br>
I still have a few more adv site features to add for this time.  I'll be doing the declaration of zones (so you can define your own room boundaries and entity-claim locations) and some material/worker assignment stuff.  It's pretty close to where I need it to be.  Then we'll move on to upgrades to dwarf mode work orders, which'll be the last major addition for this release.</li>

You can see the upper floor in the z-window on the right.  The carpenter's workshop is outside, where I made a couple of doors, a table, a chest, a cabinet, a chair and a bed.  You can now place items in unheld container buildings/items, and you can also put them on tables (where they become displayed as in dwarf mode, like my copper dagger in the image).</li>

The little bridge on the left is mine as well.  The discerning viewer will notice through the z-window that I didn't give tops to the houses, but that can be done.  Every tile takes a log as in fort mode, and the current rate is one tile per hour of work.  Fortunately, you don't need to haul everything manually -- you can lay it all out on a blueprint screen and then set yourself and your companions to work (this one only took a few minutes and three in-game days to finish with my five buddies).  When the work period is finished, it makes some of the constructions you've planned, in whatever order you set, watching out for collapses, according to the amount of workers and hours.  We're going to do a little more with it before moving on, perhaps zoning and some furniture.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> We went ahead with chopping down trees in adventure mode with some important restrictions.  It doesn't currently work on many sites from world generation -- the main issue is how it abstracts buildings and populations and so forth, which would be disrupted if there's a player-altered section of data in the middle of town.  We'll figure it out eventually, but not this time.  So you can't run around chopping down elf trees.  Felling a tree also takes an in-game hour (kind of like the composition action, but a bit faster), so it's real work and you don't just make the forest go away instantly.
<br>
          <br>
Of course, chopping down trees isn't very interesting by itself.  The reason we went forward with it now is that next we'll be using the logs for some construction options and finally adventurer-driven site creation to cap adventure mode features for this release.  More on that as it is implemented!</li>

What's up for next time is still under consideration -- while that resolves, I've fixed a few minor bugs and added a few more adv crafty bits to add on to the bone crafts (like helves and sharp rocks for stone axes).  For dwarf mode, we're leaning toward finishing the work order stuff we mentioned last time.  For adventurers, perhaps the new stone axe will chop down a tree and open up some more jobs that way, but map changes have always been trickier there, since the location isn't tied down like it is in dwarf mode.</li>

You can let the computer continue doing it if you want (and you'll continue getting "a shirt" and so forth).  The new specifications for individual jobs and engravings are more or less ready now (a few loose ends left).  The next major step along that branch of development is going to be allowing you to set details in the manager and otherwise improving the manager/workshop profiles, though I think in the interest of getting the finished bug fixes out we'll squeeze in a release before we start in on that, since there are possible time sinks lurking there.

Eventually we'll have to make the merchants more discerning, but we'll worry about that later.  You can specify each of the image elements and all of their relationships/actions, or you can select a historical figure, site, civilization, etc. and leave the worker to decide on the final image.  If you specify an exact image, it is saved so it can be used later (along with your site/civ symbols, which you can also use).  There are lots of loose ends to handle on this, but it's working well so far.</li>

I made the "really attack?" button explain more about the circumstances.  Then I added adjectives in the announcement names of people when you don't know their names, so the combat logs etc. aren't so ambiguous.  It uses their most prominent feature (either the body shape or a specific part)...  except for long hair, since I haven't made most people cut their hair yet.  After that, it was time for something dwarfy.  So I started on the ability to specify materials for tasks.  This'll possibly include further specifications for details like the shape of statues and wall engravings, depending on how all the complications work out.  There are lots of complications, but I'm going to push at it for a bit longer and report back.</li>

Bandits in camps shouldn't be placed all over the trees.  I spent a long time hunting an inconsistent map problem -- the dwarf fortress site maps were being generated differently depending on the direction you approached from.  Generally, when that sort of thing happens, it means that some piece of temporary mid-level world information is being used inappropriately in the local map generation process.  In this case, the large underground mushrooms were being drawn from too broad a population pool that depended on which sections of map were loaded, and how the caps grew out influenced the map generation algorithms for the forts, sending it down different tracks.  So that should be fixed now.</li>

There's a more specific reputation for defending settlements from outlaws, and new hearth orders for fighting off outlaws, clearing out bandit camps and fighting nearby beasts.  Nothing interesting or dynamic or gray there, but at least you can be credited now for things we already had.  Bandits behave a bit more sensibly when you fight them off -- they won't perpetually go back to the town over and over, either as a single army or as new groups from the camp.  I'm going to do a bit more with this, and then I'll fix some more bugs before the next release.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> A zombie nerf has arrived.  The animated critters no longer block, dodge, parry, wrestle or sprint, and they do charging attacks whenever possible.  Zombies no longer receive positive defense adjustments for body part types, and they don't seek or prevent combat opportunities.  Their strength bonus has been reduced.  Severing all non-smashed heads on a zombie kills it (smashing already worked), and severing or smashing any working grasp on a headless zombie kills it.  Zombies can still be reanimated if they have a working grasp.  So it's a bit confusing there with the overall grasp situation on headless zombies (it's better to target their arms than their bodies if you can't smash them entirely), and they still have some undue benefits they share with wild animals (you should be able to strike or stop many unarmed attacks with weapons), but it is much better than it was.  I still sometimes get those invincible unsmashable zombie heads.  I'll try to figure that out.
<br>
          <br>
In an arena test, my competent sword+shield human was able to defeat ten zombies at once, receiving only minor injuries.  It took some judicious selections, and some dodging to other squares, but it isn't hard if you stay away from multiple opponents.  I also set six sword humans against twenty zombies, and they won without any losing anybody.  On the other hand, I set ten unarmed unskilled humans against ten zombies, and the zombies won without losses.  That sounds about right to me -- the zombies have many advantages in unarmed combat.  So you'll have to keep your squishy civilians safe.  Incidentally, one unarmed unskilled elephant person was able to kill ten human zombies without any trouble, since they have smashing power.  Then an elephant person zombie was able to kill the elephant person...
<br>
          <br>
I fixed sparring as well.  The cautiousness personality check got flipped around with the new facets, which wouldn't normally be a problem (just a strike frequency shift), but the new drunken dwarves were 100 percent not-cautious (which made them all 100 percent cautious in the flipped check).  The roll failed every time for them, so drunken sparring partners just sat there without throwing shots.  That's normally reserved for super rare pathologically deliberate dwarves absolutely on one end of the curve, and that's not even much of an issue if their partner isn't the same way.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> I fixed citizenship petitions (the non-soldier long-term residents weren't doing them properly -- mercenaries and monster slayers remain too absorbed in work to care).  There was a problem with merchants that come back later elevated as fortress liaisons hanging out at the trade depot forever and ever, and that's fixed.  A few more give-aways for vampires have been fixed, along with a string entry problem.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> Let's see...  I cleaned up some long-standing problems with cities.  In world generation, vampires would prey on cities and eventually stop them from getting beyond the smallest size.  So we've got some cheery vampire purges now.  I fixed some problems with sewer bandits causing them to have way too many stolen items or to be placed aboveground.
<br>
          <br>
New bug-wise, I stopped the animal fights slowing down goblin towers and fixed a crash from trading goblets in saves loaded into 0.42.03 from older versions.  And some other minor stuff.</li>

          <span class="date">12/11/2015</span>
          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> We went back to fix a few older bugs -- the death/caging of invasion commanders no longer stalls their squads, one of the main causes of negative distances for building materials is fixed, training markdwarves should grab ammunition properly even if they already have combat ammunition, and seed/nut-type growths are pickable.  The "add new task" button remembers menu position like it did before.  There'll probably be a release tomorrow.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> For next time, people should use the instruments in taverns properly -- there were problems with zones and dining rooms, but the dining rooms had it worse.  Hopefully that'll fix the broken scribes too, but I'm not 100% sure on that yet.  I fixed up the horse etc. population caps, and one variation of playable horses, though since there are still playable donkeys and dogs, I haven't found all of the variations yet.  I reduced the severity of syndromes from ingested spatter (which should stop self-cleaning cats spattered with alcohol from getting sick all the time).  I stopped outside nobles from making mandates and demands and allowed goblets on embark.  I also stopped the weapon slayer list from giving away fort vampires.</li>

<li id="2015-12-07" class="dev_progress">
          <span class="date">12/07/2015</span>
          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> Over the last few days, I fixed another world gen crash, the crash from retiring certain locations and the crash from sleeping in inns.  I've cleaned up the issue with the dwarf militia not using armor correctly, and a weird instrument duplication error in adventure mode.  I also stopped bookbinders from trying to use webs (thank Knight Otu for that one -- you can add NOT_WEB below the thread reagent in your saves now if you want).  Modded wood furnace reactions are listed properly now.</li>

There are still some strange things going on (horses all over, duplicate companions, etc.), but hopefully this version will work much better than the last one.
<br>
          <br>
Major bug fixes
<br>
<ul class="itemized">	<li>Fixed world generation freeze caused by error in poetry refrains</li>
	<li>Fixed crash from building constructions on tree leaves etc.</li>
	<li>Fixed calendar crash from bandit bar hoppers</li>
	<li>Fixed crash with children joining socialize activities (most common with migrant waves)</li>
	<li>Made worship activity branch properly (so prayer needs can be satisfied)</li>
	<li>Fixed world gen seed not repeating after abort</li>
</ul>
<br>
Other bug fixes/tweaks
<br>
<ul class="itemized">	<li>Can see deity for temple in location screen</li>
	<li>Cannot spot vampires from occupation list anymore</li>
	<li>Fixed a few typos</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> I fixed a calendar crash, and a crash with children socializing that typically happened when children arrived with immigrant waves.  I patched out an adventure corruption crash, but I haven't gotten to the heart of it yet.  I've fixed the problem with the "Worship!" activity not branching into specific activities that satisfy needs (so people will actually use your temples properly now).  Temples in the location list show their deity now.  Vampires are not outed on the occupation list.</li>

<li id="2015-12-02" class="dev_progress">
          <span class="date">12/02/2015</span>
          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> With the release come the bugs, and with the bugs come the fixes!  I've corrected what is hopefully the cause of all the world generation freezes (an uninitialized poetry refrain index...), and I fixed a problem causing worlds not to reproduce correctly with the same seed.  I also fixed the older bug causing constructions to crash when placed over tree tiles.  There are still more crashes to check, so I'm going to continue to work on 42.02 for a few more days, and then I'll put it up.  Then I'll continue on with bug fixes.</li>

<li id="2015-12-01" class="dev_progress">
          <span class="date">12/01/2015</span>
          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> Here is the new version we've been working on all year!  The flow of fortress life is quite a bit different now -- specific breaks and parties have been replaced by taverns and performances and needs and inebriation.  You can designate a tavern, temple or library from a meeting area zone, bedroom or dining room using the new Assign Location option.  The location list ('l') will let you know what sort of furniture and items you need, and you can set tavern keepers, scribes and other occupations there as well.  You'll need to set up a drink stockpile and a chest for goblets in taverns for drink service to work properly, but dwarves can still drink without a tavern as before.  You can assign multiple rooms/zones to a single location.  There's a lot more -- see the feature list below.
<br>
          <br>
The bug fix list below is partial.  Large chunks of the game were changed, which has a way of making old bugs go away while bringing in new ones to take their place.  We'll be focusing on bugs old and new in subsequent releases, starting with crashing saves and moving down the list.  The next set of bug-fix releases will be measured on a scale of days and weeks rather than months, as usual.
<br>
          <br>

The crash bugs were squished though, so I'm happy enough with the outcome.  We're doing release mode tests now and going through the churn of tweaks that happens before it's ready enough to go.  There will still be plenty of issues left for you to enjoy, along with all the new stuff.  Fix fix fix, fix fix fix.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> Various tweaks with grumpy ignored residents, music descriptions vs. harmony, spectator text, and written content.  With an impressive enough performance/reputation, your adventurer can petition to be an official performer for a town (the same as the dwarf mode occupation), which doesn't mean much but gives you permission to sleep in villages and a merchant discount in market locations (also extended to hearthpeople).  Along with the tavern discounts for various reputations, it'll have to do for now in the absence of a meaningful economy.  Four more things to go.</li>

<li id="2015-11-10" class="dev_progress">
          <span class="date">11/10/2015</span>
          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> I finished up the various non-dwarf item code.  The "foreign" weapon stockpiles are a bit odd now (shrinking as you add resident races), and mercenaries will mostly ignore you if you try to fiddle with their equipment in ways that would make them drop their owned equipment, but hopefully it works well enough for a first release pass.  Diplomats will hang out in taverns for a bit after their official duties, and bandits will also occasionally arrive to relax as well.</li>

<li id="2015-11-05" class="dev_progress">
          <span class="date">11/05/2015</span>
          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> I finished up the adventure mode side of personality needs -- partially by adding an avenue for the "argue"/"cause trouble" need.  You can argue over differing values (or if you want, put forth an argument you don't agree with just to start trouble), and there are a few options, including ones that can make people angry.  You can change people's values (or change your own if you choose to acquiesce yourself), and it uses some of the conversation skills.  I fixed an old issue where brawls would automatically elevate to "non-lethal" status.  I also cleaned up some of the performance text.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> I finished handling the last personality needs in dwarf mode -- dwarves can swipe and own and wear trinkets again somewhat like they did before, for instance, with the avaricious and extravagant dwarves doing it more than others.  The quarrelsome ones can argue during chats, which'll satisfy both parties need to argue if they have it, or make them a little grumpy if they don't, though it's infrequent enough that it shouldn't be a new cause of fort collapse.  Various other needs (seeing animals, learning, practicing martial arts, etc.).
<br>
          <br>
I also made dwarves somewhat more resistant to the effects of alcohol -- creature castes can now be given an extra dilution factor vs. syndromes with a given identifier.</li>

<br>
          <br>
Bookcases, handling some issues with long-term residents staying in your inn's rooms properly, more location interface stuff...  it's a process.  I managed to get a skeletal 64 bit DF program running, finally, and I'll continue to work out problems with that once this release is out (this release will still be 32).</li>

<li id="2015-10-21" class="dev_progress">

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> Additional work was completed -- cleaned up some problems with partner dance display, got the mercenary and monster hunting resident occupations working a bit better, handled petitions that are ignored, did a bit with phrase length and registers in musical form descriptions, a little more child decision-making...  I also added a numbered tag to reactions so that they won't use up entire bone stacks making multiple products if you don't want them to (the dwarves were making giant piles of bone plectrums out of a single yak skeleton all at once).  I don't remember if this was already possible in some way, but there's a new tag anyway.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> Let's see...  you can write prose as an adventurer now.  I grabbed a blank scroll from the library with my first test character and ended up writing a (bad) essay about the historical event of me leaving my home town on an adventure...  I guess that's something.  I left it in the library for posterity.  You can copy down any poems, music or choreography you know.  I also added support for more of the new needs in more circumstances -- there are still a few that don't have enough situations, especially in adventure mode.  We might just leave a few of those as positive-effect-only needs if we can't get enough satisfaction for them for this time.  Various other tweaks.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> More stuffs done.  Tested out a dwarf reading a necromancer's book in a fort mode library.  Fun was had.  Some more prompts for adv mode dancers.  Allowed invading soldier/monster caps to be set in the init.  Old bug fixed with occupancy for units pushed by flows.  Etc.  Should clarify that we haven't done animal barding-type armor yet -- just the clothing and armor for non-dwarves that can potentially join the fort or be traded with.</li>

You can make clothing and armor for non-dwarfy critters now.  A few promises managed:  I've got goblins back on beak dogs (there were multiple problems there -- one was that they were very rare, and one was that the goblins kept butchering them), and people that aren't actively spectating (including invaders/ambushers) can still experience music around them.  Cleaned up dancing patterns -- cats and other critters were already getting in the way, and then I made the patterns a little more dynamic, so the interruptions became worse.  Now animals get pushed aside, which is pretty amusing when kitty cats keep reintroducing themselves into the dance.  And so on.</li>

I've been working a lot with art form selection and construction to give the different sorts of places, civilizations and performances a bit more character, and I stress-tested the tavern keeper.  It was messy, but the drinks got delivered.  I also added more ways for a single composition to become well-known in a civilization, and various other little tweaks.</li>

Better summaries in the menus, more opportunities for people standing around to jump into performances and pick up slack if there's room for them and they are interested, fixed some broken milling code, fixed another world gen crash, and so on and so on.  We had a dwarven dancer become so talented a century into one world gen that he invented his own complete dance form, and the bold inventor decided to pattern the motions of the dance on a troglodyte attack he suffered in his youth.  This important knowledge was then passed down to several students and then out into the world via a performance troupe.</li>

It'll tell you more about what you've learned by observation.  Before that I was messing around with non-player fortress tavern maps, as well as instrument timbre adjectives and their changes over registers.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> I mentioned back in May that I'd probably get to master-apprentice relationships for fortress mode scholars.  That's been done now.  During research discussions, if somebody is better at skills associated to the topic and has broader knowledge, the dwarves (or permanent residents) can decide to strike up an arrangement.  This will allow scholars to teach their students directly, and they can teach all of their present apprentices at once to speed things up.  We don't have general teaching yet and we don't have generalized apprenticeships, which'll take more work at a later time.  During my first test, a human doctor arrived at my library and I accepted her petition to study at the fort.  After a discussion on bandages, three of my dwarves decided to sign up and were soon learning all about pulmonary medicine from their new master.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> I've been working on additional issues related to dwarf mode libraries.  For instance, the written works of scholars are treated as sort of semi-artifacts, like named weapons, and this was leading to trouble when somebody would write on a quire and then a bookbinder went to make it into a codex.  The ingredients would be gobbled up, and the resulting object wouldn't be an artifact.  So reactions now have the ability to transfer artifact status, and there's a new historical event for artifact transformation.  There was also the issue of getting scroll rollers on to scrolls that the traders bring -- the game doesn't really understand item components at all, so I just had to add default improvements in the tool raws that civs can tack on to their items.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> The finalization has shifted from dwarf temples to dwarf libraries over the last few days.  Watching and fiddling with a churn of scholars, scribes, scrolls, book bindings, quires, scroll rollers and sheets.  You can watch them set out their writing materials on their little tables or sit in a chair to read.  The current problem is to get scribes to make the right number of copies of each written text so they don't use up all the paper, which gets a bit headache-ish to code when libraries are spread over several linked rooms and filled with different kinds of items which hold the same written content.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> I filled my fortress's temple with statues and tantruming dwarves to test out the desecration code.  After fixing up a bug with tantrums that stopped them from toppling the statues, it worked out pretty much as hoped...  one werepanda, one weretortoise, one wereskink, and two vampires.  It wasn't a full moon, so I had to wait to see the werebeasts, but the new vampires didn't have secret identities, so they showed up immediately as red monsters.  One of my miners killed one with a pick axe, though I'm not really sure if it was over the vampireness or not.  There are obviously a lot of ways this could go, and right now the game is just using the unsubtle easy one.  We'll see if there's some hiding of details in some cases, but we might not get to it for this time.

I also ensured that the player can be cursed in the default town temples as well as retired player temples.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> You can create your own performance troupes now and get people to travel around with you as entertainers.  Potential troupe-mates need to be into the arts or partying, though the magnitudes of those interests don't need to be as high if you have an artistic reputation (and you can get some of that reputation immediately by performing for them).  You can kick people out of the band, of course -- I suppose it might come up in practice if a member ends up being predisposed to bar fighting.  I was able to collect some peasants from my first village as a demi-god poet by impressing people from house to house with my recitals.  The RNG came up with "the Ace Bees" for my first troupe name (you can also pick it yourself), but it was a short and sad tale, unfortunately, since I had to kick everybody out of the troupe to test it.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> The work on adventurer composition led into finalizing the new written content generally and making sure I had handled all of the promises I'd made to various people over the last few months.  Philosophical study opens up different avenues of discussion that allow people to pass their values to both individual readers and to a lesser extent through the underlying civilization when there's a library with a copy.  This doesn't impact specific ethics yet, so you won't have to worry that an elf-written book will make all your dwarves start eating dead bodies, but such a thing is now threatened for a later date by these changes.  Poetry written in certain poetic forms can currently spread values before philosophers come up with specific language that can be used in prose, though not all civilizations will have such traditions.
<br>
          <br>
Generally, there's more information in all of the written content now, and there are more sorts.  For instance, after the difficult concept of an alternate history is tackled by historians, they can write books pivoting around the negation of particular events.  Mostly it hasn't been earth-shaking...  dwarves wondering what life would be like if an antelope man hadn't attacked their town or if a competition had turned out a different way.  One historian wrote a book considering how things would have been if the author had remained an architect instead of becoming a historian a decade before.  It would be possible to weight the event selected with an importance check, but there are complications as usual.  There are also cultural histories, genealogies, atlases, chronicles, the various biographies I mentioned before, etc., which have their proper topics and sometimes some historical events selected, and they occasionally push a value agenda when the author and form is capable of it.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> As promised, there's now a very basic ability to compose poems, music and choreography.  There isn't a lot of user input, but you can pick the form and it'll cook something up for you.  Since this should take some time for the player to do, it goes into the sleep/wait view and has some hours pass before it shares what sort of monstrosity you've cooked up.  Since everything is considered "written content" as with the necromancer (and newer) books, the titles are currently in that format.  For my first attempt, I had a novice poet write in a short poetic form that could take any subject...  much like the necromancers, he chose to write a poem about himself called the Birth of the Human.  I went ahead and shared that with everybody in the import market.  The dwarves appreciated the practice I put into it, and the humans didn't mind passing the time, but the goblins were mean and wouldn't shut up.  Jerks.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> Personal reputation as an artist (of the various kinds) is in now.  Due to the way reputation has been handled, it's currently based on live performance incident reports (making it based on what people have read will take more work).  People can speak about performances they have seen (or taken part in or just heard about), and then offer their opinion according to the skill of the performers (if they saw it), their general beliefs about the arts, etc.  You can also talk about your own performances if you want -- I told the story of the founding of the city to one shopkeeper, and then went to the next shop and told that shopkeeper about how great my oration was, and she told me how much she appreciates eloquence.  I'm sure it was a pleasure talking to me.  In any case, we should get to a few practical artistic reputation effects before the release.</li>

Right now, the option is grouped with starting conversations, but instead of shouting or praying, you can begin a performance.  Then you can choose between stories, poems, music and dancing.  Your character begins knowing the basic art forms of their culture (more depending on skill selections as well), and they can also tell stories about any historical event that they know (there are groupings and filters to help a bit with the number of choices).  You can be anywhere when you decide to begin a performance (it'll warn you if there isn't room to perform a dance).  Once you start a performance, an activity is created which will allow other people to join in either as another performer (for certain dances and music) or a spectator.  It's subject to change based on how it feels, but right now, it breaks into your performance every 10 moves or so to give you a chance to do something.  As we get more reactions and options, we'll hopefully move to a stage where you just maintain control the whole time and do meaningful things as you perform.  It's an interesting problem but we won't get to explore it much this time.</li>

All of the adventure tavern-goers do fort-mode dancing and storytelling and music and so on, and we need a few indicators there so you know more about what's going on.  We need the adventurer to be able to do all of these things themselves, and if you start an activity, other people need to join in or otherwise appreciate what's going on.  We're also going to do a little bit with composition, though as we've said before, we're not doing much with it for this time.

In the keep where I began, there were a few dwarven soldiers...  and a 'K'!  Killer beetle!  No, wait, that's Angband...  the Lady ruling the town was a kangaroo woman, and she wanted me to beat some people up for her.  You bet, just let me go to the tavern first.  Right around the corner we had an establishment.  It was called "The Cinnamon Fruit of Mouths" or something.  Let's see who thought that name up.  Through the doors, we have the tables and barrels...  and an 'h'!  Homunculus!  Do I have sleep resistance?  Oh, that's Hack 1.0.3...  then I was like, oh, a newer 'h', humanoid...  no wait...  So I looked at it.  "Hare man tavern keeper."  Well, good, all the roguelike flashbacks made me thirsty.  Barley beer in a mug!  I just need to settle up, and I can't do that until it is programmed.

We had our first barfights and our first alcohol-related death (aside from whatever fiery shenanigans and so forth you all have been up to for years).  There were a lot of things that needed to be altered or improved or fixed to get it to work.  Effects are more smeared out and syndromes can be set to add concentration up to a maximum so that multiple drinks matter, for instance.  Syndrome effects used to abruptly start and abruptly end (the peak was mostly meaningless), but now you can explicitly set abrupt starts and endings, or have the syndrome gradually grow to the peak and gradually fade.  There were issues with impaired function being permanent and with the wound display that I've fixed.  Syndromes can now be linked so that all of the alcohols go together (without this, you could drink one mug of each alcohol in the world without having serious trouble).</li>

If a large stationary instrument is available, one can be installed at the border of the activity area (the first two places I visited had a metal frame with four hanging wooden triangles and a clay-and-leather drum on a stone stand, respectively).
<br>
          <br>
I'm currently working on the new syndrome effects for inebriation -- hopefully I can do the entire process justice, from euphoria to altered personality traits (both lowered social inhibitions through the shamelessness trait, as well as a general erratic behavior alteration) to ataxia (might just use dizziness) and nausea and unconsciousness and death.  The new emotion/personality effects should be usable for a wide variety of stuff for the future and mods, like terror/rage enchantments and so on.  I'm also going to need to add some more control to how syndrome severity levels work (right now the unconsciousness effect hits any of your dwarves that dares to use the drink stockpile, and all of that clearly needs to be ironed out before release).</li>

The main push in adventure mode is going to be toward making taverns and inns lively, though I'm starting with some work on character generation to accommodate artistic knowledge and the new needs system.  This involves allowing you to select your personality, with the resulting needs being clearly shown -- there aren't that many yet, especially as it applies to adventure mode, but it'll continue to become more interesting.  You'll also be able to see and reroll your physical appearance before you start playing.  As in dwarf mode, keeping your needs satisfied gives you modest overall benefits, and it takes them a while to drain, so it's fun for roleplaying without being too onerous a burden.</li>

This means that having one random dwarf assigned to the library with no skills might not advance the state of the world's knowledge even after years of confused research (as I did with my miner, who immediately started pondering whether probing would make a good surgical technique).  You can make quite a bit of progress if you attract some dedicated scholars and support them with your own scholars and scribes, probably more than any world generation site over the same number of years since you can expend all your effort toward the work, but it still takes time.  Depending on how gregarious they are, scholars will tend toward discussing their topic with other researchers or working by themselves.  Scholars will read books that you have on hand to avoid duplicating results, though I haven't yet duplicated the master-apprentice model from world gen (I'll probably have time to do something simple there), and they can commit their results to writing (which the scribes will then copy).</li>

I'm setting up the occupation assignment for the new taverns, temples and libraries.  They work kind of like position appointments.  This time I think we're going with tavern keepers, performers, scribes and scholars.  Priests are off the table for this release since they are currently handled by a separate entity and we'll have to tackle that later, but temple performers should still be able to do sacred dances and so forth.  Tavern performers are special artists like those from the traveling troupes -- dwarves will still sing, dance and tell stories without needing to be given an occupation.  Scribes will focus on copying existing codices and scrolls while scholars will mostly just think and talk to each other.  There'll need to be some controls for that, since you don't want scribes to waste materials on extra copies while scholars need them to write down new results, but different forts will have differing priorities.</li>

I started by diversifying the "work satisfaction" thought by feeding in the job type and filtering it through the individual.  In particular, any elves that have the misfortune of signing up for dwarven life can now emotionally process the experiences of tree felling, butchery and animal caging.  We trust you'll respect this new situation in your labor settings.</li>

The current working idea is to have the long-term people petition the mayor or expedition leader for permission to stay and work in the fort, and you'll be the one in control of who gets to stay (since the decision is an official act of the fortress and not the whim of the mayor).  There'll be a little petition notification that we can use for all sorts of decisions as we go.
<br>
          <br>
If you have rooms in your inn, people you approve can stay there (there might be room in the inn for the short-term people, but that's uncertain), otherwise they'll stay in a fortress room.  If things are working out and they want to stay, you can grant them full citizenship.  That distinction doesn't mean much now (it'll acquire more meaning after our first pass on the embark scenarios), but it'll affect which locations they can use (so you can have taverns, temples and libraries for locals, for example, if you want) and it'll give them regular bedroom/property/pet claiming permissions.
<br>
          <br>
Among the adventurers, as you might have seen from world generation, there are various roles -- mercenaries will join your fortress military (for room and board at the current time, until the economy returns), where wandering monster hunters will simply be petitioning for permission to enter the caves to kill beasts, more likely.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> If the sparrow man bard visiting the fortress wrote a ballad about his experiences, would he set a lighter mood and sing about how all of the guests took their clothes off and held them in bundles while the dwarven fish cleaner recounted the tale of how the first dwarven queen came to power?  Or would he travel the darker road and sing about the human swordsman that attacked the goblin dancer outside the gates, cutting him down without regard for dwarven law?
<br>
          <br>
I think the clothing bug is caused by equipment code.  Once I plugged the visitors into the new activities, they thought they needed to have citizen clothing sets defined and found they did not, so they prepared all of their clothes for storage.  The murder of the goblin dancer is more likely the sort of thing you should expect.  Visitors to the fortress ask themselves if they would be welcome before they come, but they can't account for other potential guests that might consider themselves at war or have a personal problem with them.  It's possible we'll have some "neutral territory" behavior in place to curb the fighting if it is too common, but there's also room for the sheriff for crimes that are committed.  It'll be lend a little spirit to the fortress, in any case.</li>

I put that in today -- there are now reasonably rare instances of animal people leaving the wilderness and becoming involved with civilizations.  Our first was a red panda man that became an herbalist in a human village for some years before taking up a wandering life as a musician.  In adventure mode, you can now play as animal people if they are close to a civilization.  You can also play an adventurer from any population that has established itself as a regular part of life in a civilized site where you can normally play, so you could play an elf or even a goblin if some already live in a human city, say, but you can't currently select an amphibian person from the sewers.  Next up we should have some dev log on fortress visitors!</li>

And buckets...  and buckets in barrels.  I guess I broke lye storage sometime back when I messed with the container jobs, since they place the lye bucket in the barrel instead of just the lye.  That's fixed now.  Tweaked paper slurries and paper pressing -- I tried to set up the materials for that so it understands they are made out of the same fiber materials used for plant-based clothing, using paste and pressed states.  That should make the process of turning damaged clothing into paper easier for a later release.</li>

Now that's done.  Today I got to work on some dwarfy library stuff -- like heating limestone and related minerals in the kiln for the quicklime, and then making "milk of lime" with that, so that the animal hides can be soaked and turned into parchment.  The extra steps are there because both sorts of lime can be used for many other purposes which we will get to in later releases.  It'll be nice to build up a list of terrifying chemicals that could be sitting on a dwarven lab shelf some day, especially since we're now building up the chemistry knowledge branch to go with it, slowly.
<br>
          <br>
In any case, once you have your parchment sheets (or papyrus strip sheets, or various paper sheets made from milled then pressed pulp), then you have a choice between making scroll rollers from some hard material and then making a scroll, or you can make the sheet into a quire.  Scrolls and quires will be able to accept writing.  As a final step with quires, a dwarf can make book bindings, then use the bindings, written-on quires and thread to make codices.  There's a new basic hard-coded "sheet" item, kind of like cloth, but everything else about the process is in the various raws, getting some use out of the new ability to place improvements on products (so the scroll rollers' general properties can be maintained on the final scroll, for example).</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> Fortress visitors are coming up, so amid the pure dwarfy work, I thought I'd take a stab today at the looming problem of opening up the fortress to more permanent non-dwarf residents (to complement the ones you can already get, like the odd elf monarch and all that).  There were some hundreds of code snippets that needed to be slogged through, but everything was pretty straightforward except for military equipment/clothing.  So that's looking good.  We should have our first sense of how all that's going to work pretty soon as we open up the inns!  I'll be back and forth between that and finishing dwarfy art stuff and libraries.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> The dance activities will separate out dance areas, music areas and spectator areas now from the room of the tavern where they decide to hold the activity, and the people move off to their spots and dance/play/etc.  For this sort of spontaneous tavern activity, the area divisions are made fresh every time, so you don't need to designate anything.  They'll find the space if you leave an area without tables and chairs.  If the tavern is crowded with furniture, people will still play music and tell stories and so on.  The unit occupancy setup of one-dwarf-standing per tile has made moving multiple dancers along their patterns a trickier problem than it would be in a higher resolution setup, so I'm probably going to pass on some but not all of that.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> I've been playing around with the dwarves and their taverns and am now digging into the proper activities vs. the art forms.  Dwarves that go to a room in a tavern first group together in a general "socialize" activity (one for each occupied room).  They then organize subactivities, much like the current military training.  The poetry recitals and storytelling were pretty straightforward -- I'm doing music now.  Activities haven't done much with items until now, so there'll be a few headaches I suspect in getting the instruments to work while playing nice with the storage code and so on.
<br>
          <br>
I also added some more information for the status of needs and in what way the relevant dwarf is being affected (either positively or negatively).  Aside from the stress a needy dwarf can get from really being locked away and neglected, they also become distracted and less proficient at every task they perform when they have unmet needs.  On the other side, a dwarf that has the balance of their needs satisfied will perform tasks more successfully (in addition to the positive emotions and stress reduction they get the moment a need is satisfied).  Theoretically, the dwarf can go up to 150% and down as low as 50% in their effective skills, but in reality it'll be a much smaller effect either way -- it is difficult to fully satisfy every need at once (or impossible, if there are enough needs), and at the same time, needs don't become unsatisfied quickly and some are easily met.  Multiple needs can also be satisifed with a single action (like "keep myself occupied" and "do someting creative").</li>

In any case, I was able to get back to meaningful work today and dwarves are praying to gods and meditating on fate and fortresses and so forth, satisfying their new spiritual needs (the intensities of spiritual needs are tied to the amount of devotion in the worship sentences you are already familiar with from their personality paragraphs).  You can read about their topic of contemplation in their job entry as they go about their business in the temple.
<br>
          <br>
Over the next few days I should finally be getting all of the new entertainment stuff working in fortress mode, including dancing and instrument-playing dwarves, instruments which have been waiting to be played for like...  eight years or something.</li>

After the poetry recital and the foot race, there was a throwing competition.

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> We're well into the world gen festivals.  Their main purpose at this point is to provide something interesting and interconnecting for the new artists to do before we move on to dwarf mode.  The festivals that rise to the level of importance required for legends mode tracking are established as part of a fair in large markets with multiple trade partners, for religious purposes in temple cities, or to commemorate specific events such as the slaying of a dragon.  The game looks at the values and ethics of the civilization and the overall purpose of the occasion to come up with the schedule of events -- performances, competitions (from art to various races to wrestling to etc. etc.), processions and ceremonies, with various little details.  We're still on track to finish this part in a day or two.
<br>
          <br>
We'd also like to have smaller festivals in the smaller sites, but for space/speed purposes in world generation every village can't have things like harvest festivals every year that rise to a tracked historical level.  It's possible to get the smaller places to have as-needed incidental historical festivals in world generation (respecting a regular schedule that carries into play) to provide context for invasions and monster attacks and so on, but we'll tackle that later.  It's also possible to make the game understand what small-scale events should be going on in dwarf/adv-mode without difficulties, but we're going to limit our work on dwarf/adv-mode festivals to get this release completed.  There might be something outside of the legend descriptions, but don't expect to see a great procession with elephants and criers and flowers and banners and candles and acrobats and so on...  not yet, anyway.</li>

I'm getting started on festivals now -- world generation libraries are done, busy storing knowledge, hosting scholars and copying books.  In the last world I checked, the Bastion of Reason and the Insightful House were sharing copies of books, classics like Injuries for Everyone, The Secret Of The Path Of The Moon, Do We Understand The Year?, Dissection: Before And After, Life With The Lever, Foraging Behavior For Students, In Pursuit Of The Negation (about proof by contradiction) and Unusual Adhesives.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> I've entered the remaining knowledge outlines, and we're sitting at just over 300 simple innovations that can be abstractly discovered.  Many of them have requirements, and many don't, so it's kind of a tech forest/grassland rather than a tree.  Notably missing are innovations related to practical labors in the game (though there are some appearances) -- when the system is inevitably expanded and merged with the playing of the game, we'll deal with that, at least to the extent we can dig up reliable information.
<br>
          <br>
For fields like philosophy, I've tried not to make judgments about which ideas are "right" or anything like that, but rather which subjects can be thought about at all.  The specific view that a philosopher takes on, say, the nature of beauty or methods of education will depend on their individual/cultural values, where they apply, and a philosopher that encounters a philosophy book on beauty can then provide their own take (having acquired the innovation).  Similarly, innovations for historians are, in part, writing forms like biography, and then any historian that reads a biography can start writing them as well -- the "tech tree" for that is stuff like comparative biographies describing multiple people, with a side tree about matters of sourcing, etc.  And so on through the other seven branches -- there are innovations in naturalist writings, for example, and then they can investigate specific critters with those in mind when they get down to work observing foraging behavior or performing dissections.
<br>
          <br>
Several innovations require innovations from other branches, and since all knowledge is individually tracked, that implies some investigators will need to be at least well-read if not skilled in various topics (there aren't currently joint research projects).  There are some old and new mechanisms in place to ensure this happens.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> So you knew you were getting libraries, right?  I mean, there are all these books being carried around by traveling artists with no easy way to read them, and we can't have that.  Also, it was a little odd to imagine a library packed with art books and the occasional rambling necromantic tract -- we're in the process of solving that problem in the usual way:  I just got through with engineering and chemistry, such as they are.  The outlines are ready for mathematicians, philosophers, historians, geographers, doctors, naturalists, and astronomers.  I'm using the same master-student framework for them as they work on research projects, and they'll also consult existing books at their home libraries, of course -- a good thing, since the early tests without books led to the expected and repeated tragic loss of knowledge and the constant rediscovery of previously known facts without much progress toward advanced techniques.  It has been entertaining building up the different knowledge branches, interacting with our year 1400 cut-off, and no doubt screwing up various simple ideas and so forth.
<br>
          <br>
As it stands, the state of your civilization's collected knowledge does not impact what buildings, jobs, etc. you can use in your fort -- that's a tricky issue I don't want to get sucked into at this point.  Figuring that out for a later release is certainly on the table.  It's an interesting problem -- smaller worlds with fewer scholars don't advance as fast, and the future myth generation stuff will doubtless shake up the progression.  We're not worrying about any of that now!  All we want are wholesome libraries.
<br>
          <br>
Dwarves practice all forms of scholarship (while still preferring craftsdwarfship to books), elves do elfy stuff, and humans are variable (human values are randomized for each instance of civilization now, and there's a raw tag that sets scholar types based on the particular civ's values and jobs).
<br>
          <br>
This shouldn't be too lengthy a side-track, given that we aren't tackling any of the difficult questions where game and knowledge intersect.  Festivals soon!  Then we can move to fortress mode.  Though the focus with your dwarves this time is on taverns and leisure, there is a possibility of a fort library being a minor topic (as temples are currently).</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> While toying around with the art book code and poem/etc. composition, I thought I'd see what happens to an entire form created by an artist mid-world-generation when the only way the form can be passed around is between teachers, students and troupe members.  Most of these non-civ forms tend to stay within a single troupe, but sometimes they break out.  For instance, in a 200 year small world, we had a human from a hamlet named Usmen decide to run away from home and study goblin poetry.  I guess he was troubled by their society, because it wasn't too many years before he introduced a new form of poetry in the year 106:  a poetic narrative intended to teach a moral lesson.  He and his master Zom Frothhate joined up with a few more goblins and founded the Tan Flies, and Usmen taught the whole group the new poetic form.  A hundred years later, forty years after Usmen died of old age, the eight current members of the Tan Flies are still teaching moral lessons to their goblin buddies.
<br>
          <br>
They aren't the only ones though -- back in 113, not long after moral poetry was introduced, one of the founding Tan Flies named Stasost Tongsdemons left the group to go study elven poetry under Narena Packedman, a renowned poet who had over twenty-five students and several major works over a century of activity.  After a brief apprenticeship, Stasost went on to have five students of her own before becoming a noble ruling over some goblin pits in 131.  Two of these students, Aslot Hatedtangle and Stasost Profaneace, were taught the moral lesson poetic form around the year 120.  Stasost Profaneace is still alive, now traveling with the venerable Blockaded Horns troupe (founded in 35), though she has not yet successfully passed on the moral lesson form (her only apprentice to date was murdered).
<br>
          <br>
The other student of Tongsdemons, Aslot, was a one-armed murderous goblin farmer in the pits before becoming a poet at age one hundred eleven, studying under the future Lady for twelve years until she assumed rulership.  Aslot was murdered in 162, but he had many students of his own and one of them, a human named Atek Housetactics was deemed worthy of the moral lesson form.  Atek was born in 130, 24 years after the invention of moral lesson poetry, and learned the form in the year 150.  After losing several apprentices to the perils of goblin living, Atek managed to keep the goblin Osta Wererock alive long enough to pass along the knowledge.  They founded a troupe together called the Holy Points and are still performing.  Several new members have joined up, so there's hope that moral lesson poetry will continue to spread.</li>

You'll also see them in your forts when we get to that part.  A group of goblin poets had the honor of making the very first one, and they decided to call themselves the Fungi of Hell.  After fourty years, five of the original eight founding members had met violent ends (including one that ended up in an elf belly), and another had left to become a baron at a dwarf fort, but they were still going strong with new members, including some bards and dancers and poets-turned-bard and so on.
<br>
          <br>
After a typo, I managed to screw things up badly enough that my first large world test had hundreds of artists split into just three gigantic world-wide societies based on their art form, but I've put some controls on size and made them mix together properly again.  It would have been bad to suddenly have two hundred dancers show up at the fort and ask for drinks after a performance.

There'll be a few more days of messing around and then we should have more generated fun posted here.  This one has a few more layers than the poems -- there's the scale/note choice side of it with its own generator, the rhythm side with its own generator, and then that's combined with a choice of generated instruments (including singing) and other information in varying degrees to say what's performed/composed and how all that works.</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> Here are some of the forms generated for a single large world:  <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/early_poetic_forms.html">right here</a>.  They can be repetitive, but there's also a lot in the game that didn't appear on that page, so it should be okay overall.  There are several problems to work out (sometimes it demanded some specific hundreds of thousands of stanzas).  I need to name them.  Then we'll be on to the next stuff!</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> The generator for poetic forms is done...  I still need to have it write paragraphs describing the forms, so I'm not really sure what it is generating yet or how well it is doing it.  I should have that together soon.  I should also reiterate that we're not generating actual words for poems, and we don't have definitions for the languages up to the point where we can make certain meaningful distinctions about tone and stress, etc. (in fact, it just cooks up certain of those details on a per-world basis now to make the generators work).  That said, it does put together quite a bit of information regarding structure, content, intent and so forth.  If I'm lucky, I'll have some example descriptions tomorrow.
<br>
          <br>
From there, I can either define musical/dance forms, or get world gen poets up and writing specific poems (again, without the actual words, just what they did, why and how well -- it should be entertaining later in this release to see the game describe poems written by your skill zero dwarves and adventurers).</li>

Hopefully things will be settled soon!</li>

          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> First pass on the instrument generator is done, finally.  Lots of variables, components made of various materials (though they work like item improvements on the final product), some large instruments placed as little buildings, generated reactions to build them and their parts...  reactions can now be categorized within shop menus and they can provide information during job selection to stop it all from being overwhelming.  This is another of our experiments with just how much generated content can be used and what sorts of problems arise as you try to become immersed in your dwarves' culture.</li>

On the other hand, here is a <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=140544.msg5998938#msg5998938">Future of the Fortress reply</a> that is full of various tidbits.</li>

<li id="2015-01-24" class="dev_progress">
          <span class="date">01/24/2015</span>
          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> The new entertainment stuff is coming into focus...  been reading a lot to try and make a good first attempt, though categorization is difficult in many cases.  As usual, everything that follows is subject to change.  There'll be seven new generic skills governing the new stuff (dancing as well as music which sits over singing and 4 instrument skills), and the poetry skill that has been sitting in the code will also come to use.  We're using "poet", "bard" and "dancer" as professional names for the moment.  I'd prefer to generate those roles, but I won't have the framework for it until later, so the relevant visitors'll be more or less like the world gen hero roles for now.
<br>
          <br>
Poetic, musical and dance forms will be generated by culture.  There will be both knowledge and skill-based components to this -- so you can't compose a poem of a variety you aren't familiar with, no matter how good you are, but once you learn the rules, the quality will depend on your skills/atts.  It'll start with the poet's general skill, and they'll also develop specific skill with the form, in a way that's probably most analogous to what we were planning with combat styles.  I didn't expect this to come before those, but it did.  The quality of the outcome should depend on broader cultural familiarity or varying qualities/depths of knowledge, but I'm not going to get into any of that yet: just a knowledge check box to get started and then a few related skills.
<br>
          <br>
I've come up with a list of stats for instruments for the raws and for the generator...  we're not going to go deep into the nightmare of equal vs. just temperament and multiple materials and so on, but there might be hints of that.  There'll be skill-like stats for specific instruments as well, so you might be a wind instrumentalist, but that'll only help so much if you pick up a new instrument type in that family.</li>

<li id="2015-01-21" class="dev_progress">
          <span class="date">01/21/2015</span>
          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> Continuing to go through stuff -- breaks and generic parties are gone, needs are in, and people go to hang out at taverns and temples according to their needs.  There are simple activities set up, and the next project is to flesh those out with randomized stuffs so that we can move on to visitors.</li>

<li id="2015-01-14" class="dev_progress">
          <span class="date">01/14/2015</span>
          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> Just been mulling things over and setting up the framework.  You can assign rooms and zones to larger locations now.  Of course, there aren't many examples of such locations yet.  Right now you can just select "inn/tavern" and (to make the list larger than one) "temple".  You can name the locations in the language of your civ and they also appear in the legends in the same list with the world gen temples.
<br>
          <br>
We're not doing much with temples until later, but for this release devout dwarves will be able to pray in them (fulfilling their spiritual needs).  You select a deity from your civ's list when you create the temple.  We can probably use the same location system for groups of rooms attached to positions later on (so you don't have to reassign the mayor's rooms with every change), and anything else that needs multiple associated areas/etc.
<br>
          <br>
Next up we'll need to get the dwarves to use the new locations in new ways.</li>

<li id="2015-01-10" class="dev_progress">
          <span class="date">01/10/2015</span>
          <img src="./Bay 12 Games_ Dwarf Fortress_files/toadyone.png" alt="Toady One" border="0" class="author_img" title="Toady One"> We're going to start in on inns and taverns now.  As we said in the report, we'll hold off on recipes and generated games/gambling until the second tavern release to avoid an unseemly delay.  So what'll be in the first release?  You'll be able to define taverns for use by your dwarves and by visitors (who will know about the presence of the taverns automatically until we get to start scenarios).  The main tavern associated area will likely be a meeting hall or dining room, at your discretion -- activities will include instrument use (finally!), singing, dancing, storytelling, drinking and eating.  We're also strongly considering doing something with standing orders, at least to the point where the booze supply can be maintained.
<br>
          <br>
There'll be experiments with emotional/intellectual needs in both modes.  Socializing in taverns will satisfy some of these needs.  We'll probably get rid of "breaks" and just incorporate that time into the eat/drink/party activities according to the needs of the dwarf.  Hopefully the amount of labor time available will remain about the same, while the off-time will be more interesting.
<br>
          <br>
We'll have more information about visitor interactions as we get closer to that.  There will be an economic aspect but it won't yet be emphasized.  We're going to deal with any remaining issues with multi-species forts for this release, and there'll be opportunities to incorporate some visiting critters into your fort on a more permanent basis (most likely mercenaries/adventurers).</li>
