<h1>Bitmap Font Generator</h1>

<p>
This program will allow you to generate bitmap fonts from TrueType fonts. The application 
generates both image files and character descriptions that can be read by a game for easy 
rendering of fonts.
</p>

<p>
The program is freeware and open source, but a <a href="http://www.angelcode.com/donate.html">donation</a> is greatly appreciated.
</p>

</p>

<p>If you don't have an image viewer capable of reading TGA, PNG, or DDS files, I 
recommend <a href="http://www.angelcode.com/products/pupp/">PUPP</a>, another free product from AngelCode.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The manual is installed with the tool, but for those who wish to take a look at it 
without installing the tool first it is also available here. The manual describes both
how to use the tool and the file format of the generated files.

</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/documentation.html">Online documentation</a>
</li></ul>




<h2>Source code</h2>

<p>The source code is available under the widely known zlib license. The svn repository
is hosted at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge.net</a>

</p><p>Get the code by pointing your svn client at: <a href="http://svn.code.sf.net/p/bmfont/code/trunk">http://svn.code.sf.net/p/bmfont/code/trunk</a>.

</p><p>If you want any support with the code, then please visit the <a href="http://www.angelcode.com/forums/">forums</a>.




</p><h2>Observation on virus alert</h2>

<p>Avira anti-virus has been known to give a virus alert when scanning bmfont.exe or the installer. This is a false
positive generated by their heuristic functions that tries to predict and catch unknown viruses. I've already reported
this false positive to Avira a few times and each time they recognize it as a false positive, however for some reason
the problem comes back months later (presumably when they update the heuristic functions).

</p><p>If anyone has any idea what I need to change in the code to prevent this false alert I would very much like to know.
